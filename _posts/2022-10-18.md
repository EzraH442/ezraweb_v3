Over the years, I've seemed to be obsessed with creating flashcards
applications. This is no exception - instead of continuing with Dart + Flutter,
I've decided to create a web version of flashcards that I've envisioned. This
time, the flashcard data is stored in `yaml` files instead of a custom file
syntax, a decision that I made that would make it easier to create list of words
without errors. So far, I am happy with my decision, as creating word lists has
been less error-prone than before. When making them, I considered the trade-off
between user complexity and functionality more than when I was using Dart +
Flutter, and I feel that this has improved the experience of using them much
more than before. You can try them out
