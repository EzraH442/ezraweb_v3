We went scrambling at Mount Kidd this weekend. This will be our final scramble before our backpacking trip at the Rockwall. This scramble was brutal: we had to cross some slippery snow patches, and had to gain 1500 meters of elevation. The terrain was also pretty technichal - lots of slab with loose rock on it, which was fine going up but a pain to go down. Nevertheless, the views at the top were beautiful, and we could see over all the mountains in the front ranges. We could also see some of the high peaks, like Mt. Assinibourne, Mt. King George, and Mt. Sir Douglas.
