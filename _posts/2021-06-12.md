It's been over 2 months since I last wrote anything! If you're wondering why, I'm currently in the process of completely redesigning the website with Gatsby.
There's alot to be done, and I'm learning how to use React and GraphQL as I go. I've just finished the slugs and auto-generation of pages from markdown files
and I have to say - it's really nice. I no longer have to messily update everything manually, like I had to do with the old design, which just used basic
HTML/CSS/JS. React is also pretty epic. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of css modules, but I can see why they might be important with larger websites,
which need to compartmentalize and enscapulate some of their css.

With school, we're just finishing final exams. I wrote my chem 20-ib final, and got 95%, which was pretty awesome. We have our part A english-10 ib this
Monday and Tuesday, and I've been studying hard for that. Finally, we have a math final
