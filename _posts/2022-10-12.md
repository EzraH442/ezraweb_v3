I learned something new today:

Adieu is French for goodbye, but it is also a contraction of Ã  (to) and Dieu
(God), which makes the literal translation for Adieu, "to God".

Interestingly, the same thing occurs in Spanish: Adios is a contraction of "a"
(to) and Dios (God)

In English, the word "Goodbye" is a contraction of "God be with you". While this
seemes like a stretch, this phrase was slowly contracted over time, as follows:
God be wi' you -> God buy you -> God bwy yee -> God b'y'w -> Godbwye -> Godby ->
Goodby
